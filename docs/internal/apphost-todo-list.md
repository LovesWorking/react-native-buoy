# AppHost Implementation - Priority Todo List

## 🚨 P0 - Critical (Fix Immediately)
**Timeline: 1-2 days**

### Memory & State Management
- [ ] **Fix singleton instance ID mismatch bug**
  - Return correct instanceId when singleton already exists
  - Prevent memory leaks from orphaned instances
  - Add proper instance tracking

- [ ] **Fix race condition in rapid clicks**
  - Implement pending operations tracking with ref
  - Add debouncing for open operations
  - Ensure singleton truly prevents duplicates

### Type Safety

  - Create proper generic types for AppInstance
  - Define AppComponentProps interface
  - Add strict type checking for component props

- [ ] **Add proper TypeScript interfaces**
  - Define strict types for all AppHost functions
  - Create type guards for runtime validation
  - Enable strict mode in tsconfig

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement error boundaries**
  - Wrap each app in ErrorBoundary component
  - Add error recovery UI
  - Log errors to console with context

- [ ] **Add try-catch blocks**
  - Handle component mounting failures
  - Catch and report lifecycle errors
  - Provide fallback UI for failed apps

## 🔧 P1 - Core Improvements
**Timeline: 3-5 days**

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Split context into state and actions**
  ```tsx

  - onOpen
  - onBeforeClose (can prevent with unsaved changes)
  - onClose
  - onFocus/onBlur

- [ ] **Implement state persistence**
  - Save app positions and sizes
  - Persist app internal state
  - Restore session on reload

### Testing
- [ ] **Create comprehensive test suite**

  - Integration tests for app lifecycle
  - Performance tests for multiple apps
  - E2E tests for user flows

- [ ] **Add test coverage requirements**
  - Minimum 80% code coverage
  - All critical paths tested
  - Edge cases covered
