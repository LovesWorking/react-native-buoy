# Floating Menu AppHost Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We successfully implemented the **gpt5 pro.md** plan (App Host pattern) for the floating menu system. This creates a plug-and-play architecture where apps manage their own state internally while the floating menu automatically handles visibility.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created AppHost System (`packages/package-1/src/floatingMenu/AppHost.tsx`)
- `AppHostProvider`: Context provider that tracks open apps
- `useAppHost`: Hook to access app management functions
- `AppOverlay`: Component that renders the currently open app
- Supports three launch modes: `self-modal`, `host-modal`, and `inline`

### 2. Extended InstalledApp Type
Added optional fields to the `InstalledApp` interface:
- `component`: The React component to render
- `props`: Props to pass to the component
- `launchMode`: How to render the component
- `singleton`: Prevent multiple instances

### 3. Updated FloatingMenu
- Integrated with AppHost to launch apps
- Auto-hides when any app is open via `isAnyOpen`

### 4. Updated Example App
- Wrapped app with `AppHostProvider`
- Added `AppOverlay` to render open apps
- Converted EnvVarsModal to use the new plug-and-play pattern

## Benefits Achieved

### For Developers
- **Zero boilerplate** - No more managing `isVisible`, `setVisible`, `onClose` states
- **Single-line integration** - Just specify `component` and `props`
- **Clean separation** - Apps are self-contained and don't leak state

### Before (Complex)
```tsx
const [isEnvOpen, setEnvOpen] = useState(false);
const [envCloseResolver, setEnvCloseResolver] = useState(null);

<EnvVarsModal
  visible={isEnvOpen}
  onClose={() => {
    setEnvOpen(false);
    envCloseResolver?.();
    setEnvCloseResolver(null);
  }}
  requiredEnvVars={requiredEnvVars}
/>
```

### After (Simple)
```tsx
{
  id: "env",
  name: "ENV",
  component: EnvVarsModal,
  launchMode: "self-modal",
  singleton: true,
  props: {
    requiredEnvVars,
    enableSharedModalDimensions: true,
  },
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Host Layer**: Manages component lifecycle and mounting/unmounting
- **Stack Management**: Supports multiple open apps with proper back button handling
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed with proper interfaces

### Launch Modes
- `self-modal`: Component already manages its own modal (like EnvVarsModal)
- `host-modal`: Wraps component in a basic React Native Modal
- `inline`: Full-screen overlay with absolute positioning

### Plug-and-Play API Reference

```ts
import type { InstalledApp } from "@monorepo/package-1";

export const installedApps: InstalledApp[] = [
  {
    id: "env",
    name: "ENV",
    icon: EnvIcon,
    slot: "both",
    component: EnvVarsModal,
    launchMode: "self-modal",
    singleton: true,
    props: {
      requiredEnvVars,
      enableSharedModalDimensions: true,
    },
  },
];
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `component` | ✓ | React component that should render when the tool launches. The AppHost will mount it and manage visibility/closing. |
| `props` | – | Optional props forwarded to `component`. Use this for configuration instead of globals. |
| `launchMode` | – (defaults to `self-modal`) | How the AppHost should display the component.<br/>• `self-modal`: component already exposes `visible`/`onClose` props. AppHost passes `visible=true` and closes when the component calls `onClose`.<br/>• `host-modal`: AppHost wraps your component in a basic React Native `Modal` and injects `onClose` to dismiss.<br/>• `inline`: Component is rendered inside an absolute-positioned overlay, useful for HUD-style tools. |
| `singleton` | – (defaults to `true`) | Prevents multiple instances of the same tool from stacking. If `false`, each launch creates a new entry in the host stack. |

#### Behavioural Notes
- The floating bubble hides while an AppHost tool is open and reappears automatically once the component calls `onClose` or the host modal closes.
- If you need to perform async setup before launching a tool, do the work inside the tool component itself (e.g. show a loading state) so you keep a declarative flow.

## Current Status

The implementation is complete and functional. The app runs without the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error that was initially encountered and fixed. The floating menu correctly:

1. Shows available dev tools
2. Launches apps when clicked
3. Auto-hides while apps are open
4. Reappears when apps close
5. Keeps the floating shell in sync with AppHost state automatically

## Adding a New Tool

1. Export your tool component and ensure it accepts an `onClose` callback when it needs to dismiss.
2. Register it in the floating menu via the `InstalledApp` array using the `component`/`launchMode` fields described above.
3. Provide any required props through the `props` object instead of relying on globals.
4. Mark the entry `singleton: true` unless you intentionally support opening multiple instances.
5. Verify the tool launches from both the floating row and dial (if applicable) and that it calls `onClose` to hand control back to the AppHost.

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement

1. Add transition animations between apps
2. Support multi-app layouts (side-by-side)
3. Add app-to-app communication
4. Implement app preloading for faster launches
5. Add persistent app state across launches
