title: Network Monitor
id: tools-network
---

See every API call your app makes. Request, response, headers, timing, errors — all in real-time with zero configuration.

## Supported Clients

<!-- ::client-badges-grid -->

> **GraphQL gets special treatment** — Operation names are extracted from queries, mutations, and subscriptions, then displayed with variables using arrow notation: `GetUser › 123`. No more guessing which `/graphql` request is which.

---

## Installation

<!-- ::PM npm="npm install @react-buoy/network" yarn="yarn add @react-buoy/network" pnpm="pnpm add @react-buoy/network" bun="bun add @react-buoy/network" -->

That's it. The Network Monitor auto-detects and appears in your FloatingDevTools menu.
