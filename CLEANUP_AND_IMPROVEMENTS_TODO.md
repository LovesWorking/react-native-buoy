# React Buoy Monorepo - Post-IntelliSense Fix Cleanup & Improvements

## ‚úÖ **Recently Completed (IntelliSense Fix)**
- [x] Fixed exports field structure for all packages
- [x] Updated React Native Builder Bob configuration to ESM-first
- [x] Added proper TypeScript declaration paths
- [x] Updated smoke tests for modern exports structure
- [x] Successfully published version 0.1.8 with working IntelliSense

## üßπ **Immediate Cleanup Tasks**

### **Temporary Files & Artifacts**
- [ ] Remove temporary test file: `test-exports.mjs`
- [ ] Clean up any lingering `.changeset` files if not needed
- [ ] Review and clean up `logs/` directory contents
- [ ] Check for any orphaned build artifacts in packages

### **Package-Level Cleanup**
- [ ] **@react-buoy/shared-ui**: Still uses legacy CommonJS+ESM build - should align with other packages
- [ ] Verify all packages have consistent `tsconfig.build.json` files
- [ ] Check if any packages have unused `prepare` scripts that can be removed
- [ ] Standardize all package descriptions to be more descriptive

### **Documentation Cleanup**
- [ ] Update root `README.md` to reflect successful IntelliSense fix and version 0.1.8+
- [ ] Update `PACKAGE_CREATION_GUIDE.md` to include new exports structure patterns
- [ ] Clean up `plan/` directory - archive or organize the analysis docs
- [ ] Update `BUILD_WORKFLOW.md` to reflect new ESM-first approach
- [ ] Review and update `MONOREPO_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` for current state

## üîß **Build System Improvements**

### **Linting & Code Quality**
- [ ] Add `prettier` configuration file at root level for consistency
- [ ] Update ESLint config to handle the new TypeScript declaration paths
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks using `husky` for code quality enforcement
- [ ] Consider adding `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` rule

### **Build Optimization**
- [ ] Review if any packages can benefit from `"sideEffects": false` in package.json
- [ ] Consider parallelizing builds using `concurrently` or similar
- [ ] Add build caching strategy for faster CI/CD
- [ ] Optimize TypeScript project references if beneficial

### **Testing Infrastructure**
- [ ] Expand smoke tests to actually import and use exports (not just resolve paths)
- [ ] Add integration tests for IntelliSense scenarios with different TypeScript configs
- [ ] Consider adding visual regression tests for the example app
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual package functionality

## üìã **Development Experience Improvements**

### **Developer Onboarding**
- [ ] Create `DEVELOPER_SETUP.md` with step-by-step local development setup
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common IntelliSense/TypeScript issues
- [ ] Document the new exports structure for contributors
- [ ] Create VSCode workspace settings for optimal development experience

### **Scripts & Automation**
- [ ] Add `pnpm run dev:watch` script for watch mode development across all packages
- [ ] Create `pnpm run validate` script that runs all quality checks
- [ ] Add script to verify IntelliSense is working in consumer projects
- [ ] Improve `release:all` script to handle timeout issues better

### **Type Safety & IntelliSense**
- [ ] Add root-level `tsconfig.json` with proper path mappings for local development
- [ ] Create example TypeScript config snippets for consumers
- [ ] Document recommended VSCode extensions for optimal development
- [ ] Add IntelliSense validation to CI pipeline

## üöÄ **Feature Enhancements**

### **Package Architecture**
- [ ] Consider creating a `@react-buoy/types` package for shared TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Evaluate if `@react-buoy/shared-ui` should be split into smaller packages
- [ ] Review package dependencies to minimize bundle sizes
- [ ] Consider tree-shaking optimizations

### **Documentation & Examples**
- [ ] Add TypeScript usage examples to each package README
- [ ] Create CodeSandbox/StackBlitz examples for each package
- [ ] Add migration guide from version 0.1.6 to 0.1.8+
- [ ] Document best practices for using packages with different bundlers

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- [ ] Add automated IntelliSense validation in CI
- [ ] Set up automatic npm publishing on release
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis and reporting
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning automation

## üìä **Analytics & Monitoring**

### **Package Health**
- [ ] Add bundle size tracking for all packages
- [ ] Monitor npm download stats and usage patterns
- [ ] Track TypeScript/IntelliSense issues in GitHub discussions
- [ ] Set up automated security vulnerability scanning

### **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Audit package sizes and identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] Review and optimize React Native Builder Bob configurations
- [ ] Consider lazy loading strategies for larger packages
- [ ] Benchmark build times and identify bottlenecks

## üîÑ **Maintenance & Updates**

### **Dependency Management**
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Review and update React Native Builder Bob to latest version
- [ ] Audit for any unused dependencies across packages
- [ ] Set up automated dependency updates with Renovate/Dependabot

### **Version Management**
- [ ] Create release templates with proper changelog generation
- [ ] Document versioning strategy and breaking change policy
- [ ] Set up automated changelog generation
- [ ] Plan migration path for future major version updates

## üéØ **Quality Assurance**

### **Testing Strategy**
- [ ] Add E2E tests for IntelliSense functionality
- [ ] Create consumer project test scenarios
- [ ] Add regression tests for exports structure
- [ ] Implement automated testing in different TypeScript configurations

### **Documentation Quality**
- [ ] Review all README files for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Add API documentation generation (TypeDoc)
- [ ] Create interactive documentation site
- [ ] Add examples and tutorials for common use cases

## üèóÔ∏è **Future Considerations**

### **Ecosystem Integration**
- [ ] Consider React Native new architecture compatibility
- [ ] Evaluate Expo SDK compatibility and requirements
- [ ] Plan for React Native 0.76+ compatibility
- [ ] Consider Web/Next.js compatibility if relevant

### **Community & Contribution**
- [ ] Set up GitHub templates for issues and PRs
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- [ ] Plan community feedback collection strategy
- [ ] Consider creating Discord/Slack for community support
