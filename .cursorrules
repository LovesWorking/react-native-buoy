# Cursor AI Rules for React Native Buoy

## Critical Build Rules

NEVER run `tsc`, `npx tsc`, or any direct TypeScript compilation commands in this repository.

This monorepo uses react-native-builder-bob for building packages. Running `tsc` directly will pollute the `src/` directories with build artifacts (.d.ts, .d.ts.map, .js files).

## Allowed Build Commands

- `pnpm run build` - Build all packages using bob
- `pnpm run typecheck` - Type check without emitting files
- `cd packages/[name] && pnpm run build` - Build specific package

## Forbidden Commands

- `tsc` - DO NOT USE
- `npx tsc` - DO NOT USE
- `tsc -p tsconfig.json` - DO NOT USE
- Any direct TypeScript compilation

## File Editing Rules

1. Only edit files in `packages/*/src/` directories
2. Never edit files in `packages/*/lib/` directories (these are generated)
3. Build artifacts go to `lib/`, not `src/`
4. Always use `pnpm` as the package manager, never `npm` or `yarn`

## Before Suggesting Commands

1. Check if the command involves TypeScript compilation
2. If yes, suggest `pnpm run build` or `pnpm run typecheck` instead
3. Never suggest running `tsc` for any reason

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo. Each package in `packages/` builds to its own `lib/` directory using react-native-builder-bob.
